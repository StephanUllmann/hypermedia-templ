Following the book [Hypermedia Systems](https://hypermedia.systems/) from CARSON GROSS, ADAM STEPINSKI and DENİZ AKŞİMŞEK.

Rebuilding the examples by using

- Go
- [htmx](https://htmx.org/)
- [Chi router](https://go-chi.io/#/)
- [templ](https://templ.guide/)
- SQLite
- [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air)

The branches of this project correspond to the chapters of the book.
The book's example backend is written in Python and Flask. This repo is an attempt to convert it to Go.

Branch for [Chapter 3](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/hypermedia-systems/blob/main/book/CH03_BuildingASimpleWebApplication.adoc) is an example of an old style (Web 1.0) contacts app, entirely server-side rendered using Go.

Branch for [Chapter 6](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/hypermedia-systems/blob/main/book/CH06_MorehtmxPatterns.adoc) adds Active Search, single inline deletion of entries with swapping out the deleted content and bulk deletion.

Branch for [Chapter 7](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/hypermedia-systems/blob/main/book/CH07_ADynamicArchiveUIWithhtmx.adoc) added a feature do download the full contacts archive as JSON file. It included a UI component for triggering the archiving, polling for a (mocked) progress of the archiving and at last swapping the progress bar again for a download link.
